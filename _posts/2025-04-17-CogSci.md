Effective communication is vital for success in academics, personal life, and professional growth. Individuals who struggle with communication often miss out on much of the information presented to them. Those unable to express their knowledge risk being unfairly perceived as uninformed or lacking education. 

This research explores common communication errors in articulation and comprehension and ways to mitigate them. Research on drivers of interpersonal communication, language disorders, external aids like note-taking, and nonverbal cues like gestures reveal how these factors enhance or impair communication.
