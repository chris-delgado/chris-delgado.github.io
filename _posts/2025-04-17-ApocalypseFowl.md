I took CS 6457 Video Game Design during the Spring 2025 semester. The capstone project in that class was a team project where we had to make a video game. 

Here's a brief overview of my team's game **_Apocalypse Fowl_**:

### **Overview**  

**Apocalypse Fowl** is a third-person 3D action-survival game set on a zombie-infested farm. You play as **the Farmer**, a rugged survivor armed with a never-ending supply of egg-based projectiles. Your main goals are to **collect chickens**, **use their powers**, and **fend off waves of zombies** before time runs out.

### **Core Gameplay Loop**
- **Collect chickens** scattered across the map. As they grow, they transform into mature chickens capable of granting **power-ups** like **fire eggs** (burn enemies) or **grenade eggs** (blast zombies in an area).
- **Fight zombies** using egg-based weaponry, switching between normal, fire, and grenade projectiles.
- **Survive** for the duration of the match (3 minutes), optionally sacrificing chickens to restore your limited health (3 hearts).
- Explore the map for **bonus time**, avoid **bear traps**, and navigate through terrain like bridges, fields, and gates.

### **Key Features**
- **Strategic resource management**: Decide when to use power-ups, sacrifice chickens for health, or explore for bonuses.
- **Real-time combat** with egg-based shooting mechanics and zombie AI that patrols, chases, and attacks.
- **Immersive 3D world** with physics interactions, audio cues, interactable objects (like gates), and a humorous aesthetic.
- **HUD and Scoring System**: Track your kills, health, chickens, and power-ups. Earn bonus points for performance in the endgame screen.
